<p>3 Things to Consider When Trying to Find the Best Venue for You!</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>1. How many guests do you want, and how mobile are they?</strong><br>
Is your dream wedding small or a Broadway-worthy production? Your answer may determine the location.&nbsp;Why? Even though the day is about you, it&rsquo;s also about your guests. If your closest friends all have toddlers, is it fair to request their presence at a safari wedding in South Africa? If relatives are elderly, can you expect them to make it safely to the beach? You won&rsquo;t be able to please everyone, but consider making a concession or two if it means your loved ones will attend.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>2. Do you want a religious ceremony?</strong><br>
Fifty-three percent of couples who wed in 2007 did so in a church. A few things to consider:<br>
<br>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>A      traditional religious ceremony may have to be held in a place of worship,      so be sure to ask up front. (In that case, book the date at your place of      worship before you book your reception location.) Also, some religious      establishments frown upon elaborate decorations or flowers as well as      skin-baring dresses, so inquire about these details.</li>
  <li>If      you and your fiancé have different religious beliefs, consider having the      ceremony at a neutral location, like a reception hall. Talk early on with      both families about your decisions.</li>
  <li>If      organized religion does not play a role in your lives but you want to      incorporate a spiritual element, consider hosting the ceremony in a      natural setting, such as a beach or a park (be sure to ask about a      permit).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. How much work are you willing―or do you&nbsp;<em>want</em>―to take on?</strong><br>
  Depending on the location, you may have to do some heavy lifting. Before you commit to an &ldquo;I do&rdquo;-it-yourself undertaking, weigh the pluses and minuses of these settings:<br>
  <br>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>A      unique location:</strong>You      may have your heart set on a big wedding-day hoedown in a picturesque      barn, but who&rsquo;s going to clear out the hay, haul in the tables, set up the      Porta Potties, arrange for lighting, and―oh, yeah―move      Bessie out to pasture? There&rsquo;s also Mother Nature to keep in mind. If      you&rsquo;re planning an outdoor ceremony or reception, you&rsquo;ll need a backup      plan in the case of rain, which means twice as much work.</li>
  <li><strong>A      reception hall:</strong>&nbsp;The      establishment usually has a one-size-fits-all feel, but its staff is      probably well equipped to take care of the dirty work for you, which may      include―and this is important―post-party      cleanup.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
